<h3 align="center">Computer Science Capstone Project</h3>

  <p align="center">
    The github.io website hosts the capstone project for my CS-499 class at Southern New Hampshire University. The task involved improving final projects from previous courses in three key areas: software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases.
    <br /><br />
    I selected projects from various courses, including the IT 145 Foundation in Application Development course, where I improved CRUD functions for my animal shelter file. In the CS 260 Data Structures and Algorithms course, I enhanced the BST.cpp file, and from the CS 340 Client Server Development course, I upgraded my Salvare Search for Rescue application to a website.    
    <br /><br />
    For further details about my improvements, including an initial code review, you can visit the GitHub Pages website at <a href="https://codejr911.github.io">this link</a>.
